## 📘 About Me

I started my professional journey with a hands-on career:
🔧 After high school, I completed a vocational training as a **cutting machine operator (Zerspanungsmechaniker)**
⚙️ Then I worked for a year as a **machine setup technician**
📚 I pursued a **state-certified technician degree in Mechatronics** over two years
💻 During that time, I also took a course to become a **state-certified C++ developer** — which sparked my passion for software

Since then, I've been fully committed to coding:
🚀 I'm currently a student at **42 Wolfsburg**
🎯 I'm working on the final project **"Transcendence"**, a real-time multiplayer web app

🧑‍💼 Additionally, I work part-time at **DURID GmbH** as a **Full Stack Web Developer**, where I design and implement a complete internal intranet system using modern web technologies.
